- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wobbit54
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to fix the problems caused by FireFox updates. My browser updated and changed the Home page to FireFox and altho I try to make changes in settings and can see the preferred Home page info displayed, it keeps FireFox as the Default Home page. Also, when I try to use a bookmark, a new tab opens at the top of the browser but never displays new tab information in the lower section of the tab. I can't even contact Mozilla to report the problem, because their browser opens a tab with a cylon type dot moving back and forth before the label "developer.mozilla.org/docs/M..."
